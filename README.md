StudentWatch (shipped under the display name E-Monitor) is an iPad and iPhone app for exam invigilation. A single screen lays out 16 desks with two seats each, so a proctor can give a different amount of time to any of 32 students, watch every countdown at a glance, and get an alert the moment a student's time runs out. It is aimed at teachers and exam proctors who run individually timed or accommodated exams in one room. The on-screen interface is in Turkish, and the app is at the development stage.

## Features

- Individual countdown timers for 32 students: enter the exam length in minutes and the label counts down live
- Remaining time for every student visible at a glance
- Alert when a student's time is up, after which that seat resets to idle
- Per-student reset button to stop and clear a running timer
- 16 tables of two seats, all visible on one iPad screen, with scrolling on phones, smaller iPads and narrow windows
- Input validation (whole minutes from 1 to 1440) and deadline-based countdowns that stay correct after time in the background; timers live in memory and do not survive app termination

## Tech stack

| Layer | What is used |
| --- | --- |
| Language / UI | Swift 5.0, UIKit (programmatic views and Auto Layout, only `LaunchScreen.storyboard`) |
| Timing and alerts | `Timer.scheduledTimer`, `UIAlertController` |
| Assets | SF Symbols (`studentdesk`, `arrow.counterclockwise`) and asset-catalog colour sets |
| Dependencies | None (no CocoaPods, Carthage or Swift Package Manager packages) |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 27 or later
- iOS or iPadOS 15.0 or later on a simulator or device (test targets require iOS 17 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and open the project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CanDuru4/student-watch.git
   open StudentWatch/StudentWatch.xcodeproj
   ```

2. Select the shared `StudentWatch` scheme and an iPad or iPhone simulator, or a connected device.
3. For a device, under Signing & Capabilities replace the checked-in development team with your own and change the bundle identifier (`com.CanDuru.StudentWatch`) to one you own.
4. Run (⌘R).

No API keys, `.env` file or environment variables are required; the app is entirely offline and stores nothing outside the running process.

## Testing

Run the `StudentWatch` scheme's tests from Xcode (⌘U). Unit tests cover minute validation, deadline-based countdowns across suspension, and the classroom layout; the UI test covers invalid input, a running countdown and rotation. There is no CI.
